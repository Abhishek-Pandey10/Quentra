# INVALID-007 — Steel density = 0

> **Provenance:** `synthetic_engineering_benchmark` · `etabs_verified: false` — this is a hand-designed synthetic benchmark. It is **not** ETABS output and must never be labelled as such.

**Category:** invalid · **Fixture set:** invalid

## Purpose

Invalid material property. Steel using it is unknown (not 0 kg). Concrete is unaffected.

**Expected Quentra behaviour:** error on material, steel unknown, block finalization

## A. Structural truth

- Rebar material density 0
- B1 4T20

## B. ETABS-like input (`snapshot.json`)

- Length unit in the snapshot: `m`. All coordinates, section dimensions, bar diameters and spacings are in this unit; areas in unit², shear areas per length in unit²/unit.
- Elements: 1, materials: 2, sections: 1, design results: 0.

## C. Expected Quentra output — calculation

- Model length unit: m (1 m = 1 m).
- Rebar material B500-BAD: density 0.0 kg/m3 is invalid -> steel using it is unknown.

### Beam `B1`

```text
Length L = sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2) = sqrt(6^2 + 0^2 + 0^2) = 6 m
Section B300x600: rectangle b x h = 0.3 m x 0.6 m, A = 0.18 m2
Gross volume = A x L = 0.18 x 6 = 1.08 m3 (no openings: net = gross)
Steel: rebar material 'B500-BAD' has an unusable density -> steel unknown
Status: Included
```

## Independent hand check

These values were worked out by hand when the case was written; the generator refuses to write the fixture unless the calculator reproduces every one of them (relative tolerance 1e-9).

| Quantity | Working | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `modelTotals.netConcreteM3` | concrete still counted | 1.08 |
| `elements.B1.steelKg` |  | None |

## Expected totals

| Total | Value |
|---|---|
| Gross concrete | 1.08 m³ |
| Opening deduction | 0 m³ |
| Net concrete | 1.08 m³ |
| Steel (known) | 0 kg |
| Concrete completeness | Complete |
| Steel completeness | Incomplete (unknown: B1) |

## Expected warnings

| Code | Severity | Subject | Blocks finalization | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `INVALID_MATERIAL_PROPERTY` | Error | `B500-BAD` | yes | A rebar material density is zero or negative. Steel using it is unknown. |

**Finalization:** BLOCKED by INVALID_MATERIAL_PROPERTY
