# DUP-006 — Duplicate geometry with different IDs

> **Provenance:** `synthetic_engineering_benchmark` · `etabs_verified: false` — this is a hand-designed synthetic benchmark. It is **not** ETABS output and must never be labelled as such.

**Category:** double-counting · **Fixture set:** synthetic

## Purpose

Two objects, different IDs, same section, same end points (reversed direction). Both are counted but finalization is blocked for human review.

**Expected Quentra behaviour:** include both, warn, block

## A. Structural truth

- B1: (0,0,3) → (6,0,3)
- B7: (6,0,3) → (0,0,3)

## B. ETABS-like input (`snapshot.json`)

- Length unit in the snapshot: `m`. All coordinates, section dimensions, bar diameters and spacings are in this unit; areas in unit², shear areas per length in unit²/unit.
- Elements: 2, materials: 1, sections: 4, design results: 0.
- Run options (from `manifest.json`): `{"quantifySteel":false}`

## C. Expected Quentra output — calculation

- Model length unit: m (1 m = 1 m).
- Elements B1 and B7 have identical geometry -> DUPLICATE_GEOMETRY (both counted).

### Beam `B1`

```text
Length L = sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2) = sqrt(6^2 + 0^2 + 0^2) = 6 m
Section B300x600: rectangle b x h = 0.3 m x 0.6 m, A = 0.18 m2
Gross volume = A x L = 0.18 x 6 = 1.08 m3 (no openings: net = gross)
Status: Included
```

### Beam `B7`

```text
Length L = sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2) = sqrt(-6^2 + 0^2 + 0^2) = 6 m
Section B300x600: rectangle b x h = 0.3 m x 0.6 m, A = 0.18 m2
Gross volume = A x L = 0.18 x 6 = 1.08 m3 (no openings: net = gross)
Status: Included
```

## Independent hand check

These values were worked out by hand when the case was written; the generator refuses to write the fixture unless the calculator reproduces every one of them (relative tolerance 1e-9).

| Quantity | Working | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `modelTotals.netConcreteM3` | both counted until resolved | 2.16 |

## Expected totals

| Total | Value |
|---|---|
| Gross concrete | 2.16 m³ |
| Opening deduction | 0 m³ |
| Net concrete | 2.16 m³ |
| Steel (known) | unknown (null) |
| Concrete completeness | Complete |
| Steel completeness | NotEvaluated |

## Expected warnings

| Code | Severity | Subject | Blocks finalization | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DUPLICATE_GEOMETRY` | Warning | `B1+B7` | yes | Two elements with different IDs have identical type, section and geometry. Both are counted until resolved. |

**Finalization:** BLOCKED by DUPLICATE_GEOMETRY
